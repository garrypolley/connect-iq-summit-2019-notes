# Here Tech talk

I did this one yesterday. Doing again to see what I see differently. 

Note, I think "Here" would be good for Ambrosia. The thing that does the lunch linking via Slack at work.

So far Richard is doing much better in V2 of the talk. 

## The get your own middle

You use 315 and 135 as your `getProjectedLocation` to get the box around a point. 

`getProjectedLocation(Math.toRadians(315), 1000)`

## Map icons

Use `setIcon` and take into account where the "point" of the icon exist. This makes sure the icon matches the locations correctly.
