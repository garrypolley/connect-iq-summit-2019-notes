* Interaction
    * Design
    * behavior
    * animations

*Context of Use*

Reasons for buying/using the device

* Runner
* Swimmer
* Easy to read and use during the activity
* Buttons and touch matter
* Be consitent with the "native flow" of the application
    * Scroll
    * Swipe
    * Enter
    * Preserve battery life
* Optimize for screen layout
    * Circle
    * Square

## Design Stratigies

* Visuals
    * Keep it consitent from other places
    * Use brand at loading or launch screens
    * Use high brand contrast colors
    * Incorporate the icons you use into your app (maintain shape, but maybe change color for device, still keeping with brand)
    * Favor system fonts
        * Use them for headers/labels
        * Make sure they are not too narrow
        * Native pickers are good to ues as well
* Content Design
    * How does it "sound" -- words, images, labels
    * Keep content as-short-as-possible
    * Use words and images together
* Interaction Design
    * How does it behave during activity
    * Use animation to provide queues to how the UI is working
    * Use patterns from existing, like a list of choices
    * "Pill" with icon that takes the action
    * Optimize interaction for the use-case (e.g. don't worry too much about other activities)

# Garmin Wearables: Spotify

Want to be were the users are at. Work on as many devices as possible.

Needed to know the users who would be using it. Talk to the people who will use the service.

* Spotify is the background to the run -- backup vocals
* Follow the mental models for the platform (it's not mobile, it's a watch)
* Created by cross-functional teams
    * Product
    * Design
    * Engineers
    * Augmented by Garmin's help

## Challenges

* Buttons?!?
* Information Architecture
    * How to easily pick and choose
    * need content to be easy and quick
* User testing was difficult with a dedicated device

## Take aways

* Could have more emmotional appeal
